# Contact Manager App

Welcome to the Contact Manager app, where managing your contacts is as smooth as a well-tailored suit. This Kotlin Android application combines the elegance of MVVM architecture with the power of Room, Data Binding, LiveData, and View Models to create a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- MVVM Architecture: Bringing order to the chaos of contact management.
- Room: Your database companion, ensuring your contacts are stored securely.
- Data Binding: Weaving together the threads of UI and data seamlessly.
- LiveData: Keeping your UI fresh and reactive, like a morning cup of espresso.
- View Models: The maestros orchestrating the symphony of data flow and UI interaction.

## How to Build

To build this app, we follow a meticulously curated sequence of steps, much like preparing the perfect cup of tea:

1. Start from the local data source, because every journey begins at home.
2. Move on to defining entities, laying the foundation for our contact universe.
3. Craft DAOs with the precision of a master artisan, shaping the interface to our database.
4. Create a SQLite database, the sturdy backbone of our contact storage system.
5. Connect DAOs with the database, forging the vital link between data manipulation and storage.
6. Establish the repository, the guardian of our contact data, ensuring its integrity and availability.
7. Introduce View Models, the charismatic communicators between repository and UI, adept at surviving configuration changes and facilitating data sharing between fragments.
8. Infuse LiveData into the mix, breathing life into our UI with real-time data updates.
9. Finally, bring it all together in the View section, where the magic happens and users interact with their contacts effortlessly.
