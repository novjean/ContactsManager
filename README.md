## How to Build

To build this app, we follow a meticulously curated sequence of steps, much like preparing the perfect cup of tea:

1. Start from the local data source, because every journey begins at home. 🏠
2. Move on to defining entities, laying the foundation for our contact universe. 🌌
3. Craft DAOs with the precision of a master artisan, shaping the interface to our database. 🖌️
4. Create a SQLite database, the sturdy backbone of our contact storage system. 🗄️
5. Connect DAOs with the database, forging the vital link between data manipulation and storage. 🔗
6. Establish the repository, the guardian of our contact data, ensuring its integrity and availability. 🛡️
7. Introduce View Models, the charismatic communicators between repository and UI, adept at surviving configuration changes and facilitating data sharing between fragments. 🧑‍💼
8. Infuse LiveData into the mix, breathing life into our UI with real-time data updates. 🌟
9. Finally, bring it all together in the View section, where the magic happens and users interact with their contacts effortlessly. ✨💬
